## Geographical Data

Breaking down this definition, we find the usual components of any data driven project. The strong emphais on *geographical* marks the special attention that spatial attributes of data require.

| **capture** | record data with sufficient context to be useful                     |
| **manage**  | work with vast amounts of data, often captured in different contexts |
| **analyze** | rely on the inherent spatial relationships between data              |
| **display** | conveniently display data in its native form (on a map!)             |

### So What?

<aside class="notes">
One of the most famous mistakes, amongst academic geographers at least, is the Economist magazine’s article on the threat of missiles from North Korea.
The first map they published, shown above, did not account for the fact that the world is spherical.
It therefore massively underestimated the distance that North Korea’s missiles could travel.
As with Google’s mistake in South America, it is easy to see how this error had important geopolitical consequences.
The corrected version is shown below.

### Why Open Source

- Pros
  - Affordable for researchers
  - Reproducible research principle
  - Ease of licensing
  - Friendly
  - Available on multiple platforms (e.g. Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Cons
  - Fewer training resources
  - Less integration (Pro?)

The excellent and canonical alternative is [ESRI's ArcGIS platform](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis).
