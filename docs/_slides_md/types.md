### Raster File Formats

Some raster formats are generic image formats, and can be opened with a system image viewer or inserted into documents as images.

### Vector File Formats

- Shapefiles
- TIGER

Vector formats, even if the information is stored as plain text, need software to lay out the features as an image.
